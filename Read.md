Setting up Amazon S3 event notifications through Amazon SNS to receive notifications via email is a powerful way to stay informed about changes in your S3 bucket. Here's a step-by-step guide to  how I achieved this:

1. **Create an S3 Bucket**:
   - I created an S3 bucket where I want to monitor events.

2. **Create an Amazon SNS Topic**:
   - In Amazon SNS service and I created a new topic.
   - I updated the SNS access policy.

3. **Add Email Subscribers**:
   - In the SNS topic settings, I added my email address as a subscriber. This is where the S3 event notifications will be sent.

4. **Confirm Subscription**:
   - After adding an email subscriber, I received an email from Amazon SNS with a confirmation link. Clicked the link to confirm my subscription.

5. **Configure S3 Event Notification**:
   - Got to the properties of my S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigated to the "Events" section and selected the type of event I wanted to monitor (e.g., "All object create events").
   - Choose the Amazon SNS topic I created as the destination for these events.

6. **Customize Email Notifications (Optional)**:
   - In the SNS topic settings, you can customize the subject and message format of the email notifications that will be sent to your email address.

7. **Test the Configuration**:
   -  I uploaded a test object to my S3 bucket to trigger the event notification.
   - I receiveD an email notification based on the event configuration.

With this setup, whenever the specified S3 event occurs in my bucket (e.g., an object is uploaded), Amazon S3 will send an event notification to the Amazon SNS topic. Amazon SNS will then forward the notification to my email address as configured.

Remember that email notifications can provide a convenient way to stay updated on events in your S3 bucket.
